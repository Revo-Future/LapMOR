This C++ program is used for the sparse multiple regression model: LapMOR. 

Usage: 
Please use src/train_LapMOR.h to train you model. 
Note that for a regression: Y = XB + E,
you need to specify: X,Y,lambda1 and lambda2; 
our algorithm will estimate B and A; 

Please use cross-validation to train you lambda1 (lambda1>0) and lambda2 (0<=lambda2<=1).

Detailed Parameters: 
input - the matrix X, 
output - the matrix Y,
B - the regression coeficients, 
A - the sparsity of each row, 
lambda1 - a positive sparsity parameter specified by user. 
lambda2 - the proportion of Laplacian prior specified by user.
